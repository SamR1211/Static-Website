          <p>
          Per my understanding, computational thinking is taking a problem and trying to understand what steps need to be taken in order to solve it. The 4 key techniques (decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithms) enable us to arrive at possible solutions. We then decide how this solution would be best input to a computer in order to achieve the desired output.

            Personally, developing my computational thinking skills is vitally important. I will need to use computational thinking consistently throughout the MSc Computing course. For example, when tasked with building a website or web-based application using a variety of coding languages it would be beneficial for me to decompose this task into smaller tasks while abstracting away from unnecessary concepts. Furthermore, using pattern recognition to create more efficient and shorter code would be a fantastic outcome of using computational thinking during my studies. In particular, abstraction and pattern recognition could go a long way to making my code more readable, concise and efficient. As well as this, algorithms are abundant in the work I will need to do for MSc Computing, particularly in the optional databases module I have selected.

            In terms of a future career computational thinking would be of great benefit in many roles across tech such as software engineer, data analysis and more. In recent years the UK has suffered from a shortage of workers who are sufficiently skilled when it comes to computational thinking leading to the demand being greater than the supply in the national workforce [1]. As well as this computational thinking can be extremely useful even in jobs outside of the tech industry. Being able to work through a problem in a logical and concise manner while abstracting away from irrelevant topics and ideas would be an ideal skill to possess.
