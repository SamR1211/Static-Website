            Tim Berners-Lee is a trailblazer in the field of computer science, having invented the World Wide Web, one of the most significant technological innovations of modern times. Born on June 8th, 1955, in London, Tim is the eldest of four siblings. His parents, Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee were both computer scientists who had contributed to the development of the first commercially produced computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. Tim was fascinated by his parents' work and their accomplishments instilled in him a fascination with computing and its potential from a young age [2].

            Tim attended The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, earning a degree in Physics, setting the stage for his impressive career. Following his graduation, Tim held various roles, including working as an engineer for a telecommunications company, running the technical side of a computing company in England for three years, and even working as an independent contractor at CERN. During his early stint at CERN, Tim built a prototype which he named ENQUIRE. ENQUIRE was based on hypertexts and aimed to make life easier for his peers by allowing them to share and update files using hypertext technology. After a couple of years away Tim returned to CERN in 1984. In 1989 during his second stint at CERN, Tim went on to create the World Wide Web. Tim used various existing technologies, including those similar to his own ENQUIRE prototype and the internet and linked them together to alleviate researchers of their ongoing problems with sharing and accessing information easily. The Web marked the end of an era of frustrating and debilitating incompatibility between computer systems, it created an explosion of accessibility, with many potential social and economic impacts [3]. By August 1991, the World Wide Web was accessible to the public and has gone on the drastically alter how we can communicate and share information with people all across the globe.

            Berners-Lee did not aim to profit from his invention and kept it royalty-free ensuring that the world could reap the full benefits of his crowning invention. Since 1989, Tim has been at the forefront of web development, in 1994 he founded the World Wide Web Consortium which continuously puts efforts towards advancements in web development.
            Timâ€™s achievements have earned him a plethora of awards, including being knighted in 2004 and a Turing Award in 2017.
