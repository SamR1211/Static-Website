            The first thing I learned during the CMT119 module was the difference between the natural languages that humans communicate in compared to the formal languages understood by computers. This was a useful first step as it helped me understand that I needed to approach problems in a different way and to break them down into logical easily understood steps. After this, I learned about the 4 core techniques of computational thinking. I am already reaping the benefits of this in CMT120, when tasked with programming challenges I can apply these techniques to allow me to come to appropriate solutions. I am using decomposition frequently to break my challenges down into more manageable parts and I am certain that all 4 techniques will continue to be of great use to me throughout my studies and beyond.

            Furthermore, I learned some programming in JavaScript and some of the general building blocks of programming languages such as variables, literals, operators etc. For example, learning about functions was important as I could tell that I was struggling with the syntax and how to define and call a function. Discovering this was important as I was able to spend additional time ensuring I was comfortable with these concepts, and this has made CMT120 easier. Going forward, the foundational introduction to these building blocks that are shared across many languages will make it easier for me to adapt to new languages faster. Moreover, I feel that learning the importance of commenting on my code was a vital thing to learn early on in my studies. Ensuring I comment on code that cannot be easily read will help me complete projects. If I have an assignment that Iâ€™m working on for weeks or months at a time, then commenting on my code will help me to understand what I have already written so that I do not get confused every time I revisit it.

            I have also learned significantly about HTML and CSS during CMT119. At first, my HTML was messy and unorganized and was not using the best use of features such as nesting and classes. In turn, this gave me difficulties when trying to target elements in my CSS document as I was not able to good use of selectors and ended up with very clumped-together features. Learning how to write HTML and CSS concisely and efficiently will set me in good stead for the rest of my studies as it is important to strive for this whether it be in HTML/CSS or languages such as Python and JavaScript.

            Lastly, the computer fundamentals lecture was and will be useful going forward as I gained a deeper understanding of why certain things may or may not work when I am programming in the future. For example, learning that only a certain number of numbers can be represented in C# may prove useful in future projects.
